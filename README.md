COP4655: Proof of Concept for Final Project
"StockView" is a mobile application that utilizes Java and APIs to display stock market news and a search functionality for looking up information on stocks.
This mobile application was a final project for my mobile applications course in Spring 2021, currently it is in an incomplete state but I have left this here
to return to it when I had free-time. This was one of the first times I have used GitHub.

This project was done in Android Studio with the connection to Firebase to be able to login with Google.
To showcase this app I used an andriod emulator.
Once you are logged in, the user is able to search for stocks, bookmark them/remove them from your bookmark, and look through stock news.
